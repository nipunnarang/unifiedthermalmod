# Nexus 6P Unified Thermal Mod (UTM) [![Magisk](https://img.shields.io/badge/Magisk-19%2B-00B39B.svg?style=flat-square)](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445) [![Forum](https://img.shields.io/badge/XDA-Forums-f59714.svg?style=flat-square)](https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/development/mod-cttmod-xthermal-fast-charge-unified-t3673481)

## Information
This module modifies the stock thermal configuration file (thermal-engine.conf) for the Nexus 6P with a modified thermal configuration file that raises the thermal throttling temperature limits for a higher sustained performance as well as increases the fast-charge current limits for a faster fast-charge. Both of these changes come at the cost of heat, i.e. slightly increased temperatures than stock, meaning your phone will feel slightly warmer as compared to an unmodified device. In case you wish to install the modified libraries directly in the system partition and not as a Magisk module, then add "sysover" (without the quotes) to the zip name and flash it via TWRP.

**Note:** The zip will abort the installation if you try to flash it on any other device except the Nexus 6P and if you aren't running Android Marshmallow, Nougat, Oreo or Pie.
